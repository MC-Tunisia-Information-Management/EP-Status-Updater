# EP-Status-Updater
The "Update Status Of EP" function retrieves data from the AIESEC API for individuals listed in a Google Sheets spreadsheet named "LIVE". It iterates through each row starting from the second row (skipping the header) to fetch the status of each individual using their ID and an access token. If the retrieved status is not "open", it updates the corresponding row's "Status" in column H of the spreadsheet. It logs updates and errors to the console, handling cases where the API response lacks expected data or encounters errors during the request process. This script facilitates real-time status updates based on external data for efficient data management and tracking.
